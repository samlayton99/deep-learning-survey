## Getting Started

1. Each part is contained in a Jupyter notebook that can be run locally or in Google Colab
2. The notebooks include both explanations and coding exercises
3. For optimal performance, especially in later sections, using a GPU is recommended
4. Follow the parts sequentially for the best learning experience

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Additional libraries as required by specific notebooks

## Usage

Open the notebook files (.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab. Each notebook contains a "Open in Colab" button for easy access to a GPU-enabled environment.
